## I am interested in Python, Rust, JavaScript, and electrical engineering.

Currently learning Python. I am a beginner in everything, but I have a strong drive and passion for learning new technologies and skills.

I love programming, just like everybody else here of course. I want to be able to program at least hello world in many different languages and just have an understanding of many programming languages and how they work (compilers, interpreters, standards). 

I also am interested in pursuing full stack web development, cybersecurity, and electrical engineering for my future career.

### Languages I would like to learn
- Python (and Flask framework)
- JavaScript (and web development with HTML and CSS)
- Rust
- C++
- Haskell
