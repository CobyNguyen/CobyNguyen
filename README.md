## I am interested in Python, Rust, and JavaScript.

Currently learning Python. Next year I will be taking a Java course though.

I love programming, just like everybody else here of course. I want to be able to program at least hello world in many different languages and just have an understanding of many programming languages and how they work (compilers, interpreters, standards).

I am interested in full stack web development, cybersecurity, and programming applications

###Languages I would like to learn
- Python
- JavaScript (and web development with HTML and CSS)
- Rust
- C++
- C
- Haskell
- SQL
- PHP
- Java
